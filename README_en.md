# ðŸ‘€ Important Notes
1. This project is a "Web Slideshow Application", not a "Low-code Platform", "H5 Editor", "Image Editor", "Whiteboard Application", etc.
2. The target audience of this project is <b>developers who have a need for [Web Slideshow] development</b>. The provided link is just a demo address and does not provide any online services. You should not use this project directly as a tool, nor is it supported out-of-the-box.
If you just need a service or tool, you can choose more excellent and mature products, such as: [Slidev](https://sli.dev/), [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/), etc.
3. This project is based on DOM rendering, with the advantage of being easy to get started and extend. However, compared to Canvas rendering solutions, there may be some performance gaps in complex scenarios, so if you have high performance requirements, this project may not be a good choice/reference direction.
